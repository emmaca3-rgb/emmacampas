A worthy successor of the best guitar tradition, she pushes its limits to new grounds with her singing, her unique connection with the public, and an unquestionable technique.

During her musical training, Emma opted for a polyhedric approach that would lead her to perform both classical and flamenco styles. Her repertoire is a wide range from the Renaissance to contemporary creations, with an emphasis on the Spanish music.

She currently attends the [«Robert Schumann Hochschule für Musik»][1] (Master-Düsseldorf) and receives artistic guidance from [Alexander Ramírez][2], Eduardo Inestal and [Joaquín Clerch][3].
